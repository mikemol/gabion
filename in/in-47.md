# in/in-47.md — Erasure morphism witness schema (proposal)

## Purpose
Specify what counts as an erasure act and what artifact is needed to prove it happened.

## Proposed witness schema
Required fields:
- `taint_kind`
- `source_suite_id`
- `target_suite_id`
- `eraser_id`
- `input_shape`
- `output_shape`
- `policy_basis`
- `justification_code`

Optional fields:
- `owner`
- `expiry`
- `notes`

## Deterministic identity contract
Witness identity is computed from canonicalized required fields only.
- stable key ordering
- no timestamp input
- no environment-dependent values

## Invalid witness classes
- unknown taint kind
- source/target not present in current forest
- identity non-determinism across equivalent runs
- expired exemption metadata

## Artifact relation (proposal)
- JSON relation keyed by `witness_id`
- markdown summary grouped by taint kind and boundary
- baseline/delta integration for ratcheting unresolved crossings
