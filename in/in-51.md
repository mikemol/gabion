# in/in-51.md — Type ambiguity erasure at ingress boundaries

## Purpose
Formalize `type_ambiguity` as ingress-local taint that must be erased before strict-core entry.

## Ambiguity sources (proposal)
- `Optional[...]`
- `T | None`
- `Any`
- unshaped object payloads with unknown field contracts

## Required erasure patterns (proposal)
- constructors that enforce total types
- protocol/dataclass reification
- explicit normalizers converting permissive payloads to strict contracts

## Crossing rule
No permissive type shape may enter strict core without an erasure witness linking input shape to output strict type contract.

## Temporary exemptions
Allowed only with:
- `owner`
- `reason`
- `expiry`

Expired exemptions are treated as unresolved strict-region taint.
