## Convergence and Promotion Lifecycle for Quotient + Graded Test Optimization

### Purpose
Define adoption, promotion, demotion, and recovery semantics for the full quotient and graded execution protocol chain.

### Non-goals
- This step does not replace underlying policy seed governance.
- This step does not force immediate strict-profile adoption.
- This step does not remove the need for local diagnostic autonomy.

---

## Status
- **This step installs:** lifecycle gates for activating and maintaining the protocol.
- **This step depends on:** `in-54` through `in-57` artifact and ratchet readiness.
- **This step unblocks:** stable long-term operation with explicit rollback semantics.
- **Failure mode if absent:** protocol adoption is ad hoc and regressions lack controlled remediation.

---

## Definitions
- **Adoption profile:** operational mode (`observe`, `contain`, `enforce`).
- **Promotion gate:** required readiness predicate bundle for profile advancement.
- **Demotion trigger:** deterministic condition requiring profile rollback.
- **Recovery bundle:** minimal artifact/actions required to clear demotion trigger.

---

## Face / Kit / Solver

### Face (Obligations)
- **F58-1:** Promotion requires green checks from model, migration, execution, and governance layers.
- **F58-2:** Demotion triggers shall be explicit, deterministic, and auditable.
- **F58-3:** Recovery procedures shall preserve artifact continuity and provenance.
- **F58-4:** Lifecycle decisions shall be encoded in machine-readable reports.

### Kit (Existing machinery)
- Staged lifecycle framing from `in/in-53.md#in_in_53`.
- Quotient model and migration outputs (`in-54`, `in-55`).
- Graded execution and governance outputs (`in-56`, `in-57`).

### Solver (Implementation plan)
1. Define readiness predicates per adoption profile.
2. Evaluate promotion gates from ratchet and telemetry artifacts.
3. Emit promotion/demotion decisions with reason codes.
4. On demotion, execute recovery bundle and re-evaluate deterministically.

---

## Artifact Contract

### Required artifacts
#### `out/quotient_protocol_readiness.json`
- **Schema:** profile, gate predicates, pass/fail details
- **Determinism:** predicate ordering and IDs stable

#### `out/quotient_promotion_decision.json`
- **Schema:** decision, target profile, rationale codes, timestamp metadata
- **Determinism:** rationale code set canonical

#### `out/quotient_demotion_incidents.json`
- **Schema:** trigger id, impacted profile, recovery requirements, closure status
- **Determinism:** trigger taxonomy fixed

### Provenance
- Decisions are reproducible from captured artifacts.
- Recovery actions are linked to the exact trigger and closure evidence.

---

## Admissibility
- **Admissible:** staged promotion when all required gates are satisfied.
- **Inadmissible:** forced promotion with unresolved governance or quality failures.
- **Ambiguity policy:** lifecycle uncertainty is emitted as explicit undecided state, not implicit success.
- **Non-explosion policy:** profile progression is monotone under green gates; exceptions are explicit and bounded.

---

## Checks as Lemmas
- **Lemma L58-1:** promotion decisions are derivable from readiness artifacts alone.
- **Lemma L58-2:** demotion triggers are complete and non-overlapping.
- **Lemma L58-3:** recovery completion clears the originating trigger deterministically.
- **Lemma L58-4:** lifecycle reports preserve provenance links to `in-54..57` artifacts.

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Protocol can run in observe mode with complete artifact chain.
- [ ] Promotion to stricter profiles is deterministic and auditable.
- [ ] Demotions are actionable with bounded recovery paths.
- [ ] Long-lived operation maintains drift resistance and localization quality.

---

## Failure Modes and Diagnostics
- **FM58-1:** Gate ambiguity → conflicting promotion outcomes.
- **FM58-2:** Hidden demotion trigger → silent reliability decay.
- **FM58-3:** Recovery incompleteness → oscillating profile state.
- **FM58-4:** Provenance gaps → unverifiable lifecycle decisions.
