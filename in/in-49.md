# in/in-49.md — Unified taint ledger (state/baseline/delta)

## Purpose
Unify current ambiguity/baseline/delta mechanisms under a single taint-debt ledger.

## Proposed artifacts
- `taint_state.json`: full current crossings and witness status.
- `taint_baseline.json`: accepted debt snapshot.
- `taint_delta.json`: net-new and resolved items versus baseline.

## Record model
Each record includes:
- `taint_kind`
- `source_suite_id`
- `target_suite_id`
- `boundary_id` (if applicable)
- `status` (`resolved`, `unresolved`, `exempt`, `expired_exempt`)
- `witness_id` (if resolved)

## Ratchet policy (proposal)
- fail on net-new unresolved strict-region crossings.
- allow unchanged baselined debt during migration.
- require monotonic debt reduction for promotion milestones.

## Profile semantics (proposal)
- `experimental`: warn by default.
- `boundary`: fail on missing witness at declared crossings.
- `strict-core`: fail on any unresolved ingress taint.
