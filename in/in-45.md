# in/in-45.md — Promotion protocol (experimental → boundary → strict-core)

## Purpose
Define a staged readiness model driven by taint erasure completeness.

## Proposed phases
1. **Observe:** collect taint state only.
2. **Label:** mark boundaries and profiles.
3. **Contain:** require legal loci for permissive→strict crossings.
4. **Erase:** require witnesses for all strict ingress crossings.
5. **Promote:** enforce strict-core fail criteria.

## Promotion gates (proposal)
A unit is promotable only when:
- no unresolved strict-region crossings remain,
- no expired exemptions exist,
- deterministic witness/ledger artifacts are reproducible,
- control-budget exceptions are either cleared or formally justified.

## Demotion triggers (proposal)
- net-new unresolved strict ingress taint,
- witness identity instability,
- exemption expiry without remediation.

## Suggested reporting payload
- profile
- taint counts by kind
- unresolved crossing list
- exemption list (with expiry)
- promotion decision and reason codes
