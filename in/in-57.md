## Governance Ratchets for Quotient and Graded Execution

### Purpose
Install CI-governed ratchets that preserve quotient integrity, routing quality, and drift resistance.

### Non-goals
- This step does not prescribe one permanent ontology version.
- This step does not block exploratory local workflows outside policy gates.
- This step does not redefine promotion lifecycle semantics.

---

## Status
- **This step installs:** ontology, assignment, and routing ratchets with explicit violation reporting.
- **This step depends on:** artifacts from `in-54`, `in-55`, and `in-56`.
- **This step unblocks:** promotion decisions that are evidence-backed (`in-58`).
- **Failure mode if absent:** protocol quality drifts silently and optimization gains decay.

---

## Definitions
- **Ontology drift:** net-new uncontrolled axis/token/class vocabulary growth.
- **Assignment debt:** unresolved mappings not covered by approved exemptions.
- **Routing quality floor:** minimum precision/latency envelope for graded routes.
- **Ratchet delta:** structured report of net-new debt vs baseline.

---

## Face / Kit / Solver

### Face (Obligations)
- **F57-1:** Ontology expansion shall require explicit declaration and review note.
- **F57-2:** Assignment debt shall not increase without approved exception.
- **F57-3:** Routing quality shall not regress below profile floors.
- **F57-4:** All violations shall be emitted with deterministic reason codes.

### Kit (Existing machinery)
- Policy and clause-index governance model.
- Assignment and routing telemetry artifacts.
- Existing CI reporting and ratchet mechanisms.

### Solver (Implementation plan)
1. Define baseline snapshots for ontology, assignment debt, and routing quality.
2. Compute ratchet deltas on each run.
3. Enforce fail/warn policy by profile and branch context.
4. Persist violation payloads and remediation hints.

---

## Artifact Contract

### Required artifacts
#### `out/quotient_governance_report.json`
- **Schema:** profile summary, debt metrics, quality metrics, decision
- **Determinism:** metric naming and ordering stable

#### `out/quotient_ratchet_delta.json`
- **Schema:** baseline vs current deltas with reason codes
- **Determinism:** baseline identifier pinned

#### `out/quotient_policy_violations.json`
- **Schema:** violation id, clause, severity, remediation path
- **Determinism:** clause IDs and reason codes stable

### Provenance
- Baselines are explicit and revision-addressed.
- Violations are surfaced; no silent suppression in strict profiles.

---

## Admissibility
- **Admissible:** approved exceptions with owner, reason, expiry.
- **Inadmissible:** net-new debt without declared exception path.
- **Ambiguity policy:** policy uncertainty is emitted as explicit governance ambiguity.
- **Non-explosion policy:** ratchets prioritize debt reduction and class stability.

---

## Checks as Lemmas
- **Lemma L57-1:** ontology diff is empty or explicitly approved.
- **Lemma L57-2:** unresolved assignment debt is non-increasing.
- **Lemma L57-3:** routing metrics satisfy profile floors.
- **Lemma L57-4:** all violations map to canonical clause/reason identifiers.

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Drift is visible and bounded by ratchets.
- [ ] New classes/tokens are intentional and reviewable.
- [ ] Graded execution quality remains above profile floors.
- [ ] Violation payloads are actionable in CI and local repro loops.

---

## Failure Modes and Diagnostics
- **FM57-1:** Ontology sprawl → class identity becomes unstable.
- **FM57-2:** Debt creep → unresolved mapping backlog blocks promotion.
- **FM57-3:** Quality erosion → escalations become expensive and uninformative.
- **FM57-4:** Opaque violations → contributors cannot remediate quickly.
