# in/in-42.md — Boolean ambiguity taint and erasure

## Purpose
Model implicit truthiness as `boolean_ambiguity` taint requiring explicit erasure before strict-core use.

## Ambiguity sources (proposal)
- non-bool expression in `if`/`while` condition
- ternary condition with non-bool expression
- implicit container/object truth tests

## Lawful erasures (proposal)
- explicit comparisons (`is None`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, etc.)
- typed predicate wrappers that return `bool`
- explicit boundary normalization to strict `bool`

## Strict-core disallow list (proposal)
- `if x:` where `x` is not statically bool
- chained truthiness guards encoding hidden branching intent

## Witness requirements
Each erased boolean ambiguity crossing records:
- source condition shape
- normalized boolean predicate form
- boundary locus and eraser identifier
