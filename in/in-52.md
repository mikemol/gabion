# in/in-52.md — Control ambiguity budgets and essential-branch justification

## Purpose
Reframe branch fanout and nesting as `control_ambiguity` taint with measurable budgets.

## Proposed metrics
- branch fanout per SuiteSite/function
- branch nesting depth
- conditional density

## Proposed profile thresholds
- `experimental`: advisory thresholds
- `boundary`: enforce moderate thresholds + require justification for excess
- `strict-core`: strict thresholds, net-new excess fails

## Essential-branch contract
Branches exceeding strict-core budgets require explicit justification metadata:
- `justification_code`
- `owner`
- `reason`
- `expiry` (if temporary)

## Ratchet model
- baseline current excess
- block net-new excess
- tighten thresholds over milestone windows
