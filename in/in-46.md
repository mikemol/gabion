# in/in-46.md — Fiber coloring core for taint-permitted vs strict regions

## Purpose
Define the core color model for execution/dataflow graphs:
- `taint_permitted` regions tolerate ambiguity at ingress/edge boundaries.
- `taint_forbidden` regions (strict core) require ambiguity erasure.

This document is non-normative and proposes a unifying interpretation for existing Gabion audits.

## Non-goals
- Does not change CI/policy behavior.
- Does not add new required checks in this step.
- Does not deprecate existing report/baseline artifacts.

## Status
Hypothetical and non-normative proposal. Normative governance remains in [POLICY_SEED.md#policy_seed](POLICY_SEED.md#policy_seed).

## Proposed laws
1. **Color transition law:** any edge from `taint_permitted` to `taint_forbidden` must factor through an explicit erasure morphism.
2. **No silent crossing:** direct permissive→strict crossings without erasure are invalid.
3. **No ambient erasure:** erasure is a localized action, not an implicit property of downstream code.

## Taint kinds (initial)
- `type_ambiguity`
- `boolean_ambiguity`
- `control_ambiguity`
- `temporal_budget` (optional extension)

## Admissibility (proposal)
Admissible:
- producing deterministic crossing records keyed by SuiteSite identity.
- preserving legacy reports while adding color metadata.

Inadmissible:
- introducing hidden erasures with no witness.
- allowing strict-core ingress from permissive sources without boundary discharge.

## Checks as lemmas (proposal)
- L1: every permissive→strict crossing has exactly one erasure witness.
- L2: witness identity is deterministic across re-audit.
- L3: removing a witness produces a stable, classifiable violation.
