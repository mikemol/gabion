# in/in-48.md — Boundary registry for legal erasure loci

## Purpose
Constrain erasure to declared boundaries so ambiguity cleanup cannot occur “anywhere.”

## Proposed boundary registry
Each entry includes:
- `boundary_id`
- `suite_id` (or module/path selector)
- `allowed_taint_kinds`
- `owner`
- `reason`
- `expiry` (required for temporary entries)

## Proposed rules
1. Erasure witnesses are valid only at declared boundary loci.
2. Strict-core suites cannot host taint-permitted facets.
3. Temporary legacy boundaries must expire or be promoted to permanent reviewed boundaries.

## Migration mode
- Start in observe-only mode.
- Emit advisory violations for out-of-registry erasures.
- Promote to fail-on-new after baseline stabilization.
