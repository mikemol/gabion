justification: marker protocol generalization now classifies todo/deprecated marker kinds in runtime never/todo/deprecated markers and static alias-map extraction while preserving crosswalk row coverage; current taint diagnostic and marker-ingress refinements preserve existing ASPF crosswalk obligations and identifier anchors; decision-protocol module markers introduced for policy compliance do not alter marker/ASPF identifier mappings; boundary-normalization markers on taint/ci-watch payload extraction helpers are policy-annotation only and do not alter ASPF identifier mappings or taint crosswalk semantics; marker reason coercion to string at payload normalization is runtime-hardening for invariant throws and does not change ASPF identifier anchors or taint crosswalk semantics. legacy_pattern_schema_id now reuses identity_contract.build_identity_contract for digest computation to eliminate remaining local hashing duplication in pattern_schema without changing legacy identifier shape or ASPF crosswalk semantics. identity spine bootstrap in src/gabion/analysis/identity_contract.py and pattern-schema wiring centralize canonical hashing/normalization for schema IDs only, preserving existing ASPF taint/isomorphism identifiers and crosswalk coverage. cleanup removes redundant local schema-canonical payload helper in pattern_schema after identity_contract routing, without changing ASPF taint/isomorphism identifiers or crosswalk semantics. legacy_pattern_schema_id now reuses identity_contract.build_identity_contract for digest computation to eliminate remaining local hashing duplication in pattern_schema without changing legacy identifier shape or ASPF crosswalk semantics. normalize_signature now delegates to identity_contract.normalize_identity_mapping to remove duplicated normalization logic while preserving prior schema canonicalization behavior and ASPF crosswalk semantics. legacy_pattern_schema_id now reuses identity_contract.build_identity_contract for digest computation to eliminate remaining local hashing duplication in pattern_schema without changing legacy identifier shape or ASPF crosswalk semantics.
